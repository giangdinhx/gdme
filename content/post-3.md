# Architecting a Calm Productivity System

Integrating your calendar, tasks, and notes into a single, seamless flow.

A well-designed productivity system reduces cognitive load and helps you focus on what matters most.

## The Core Components

### 1. Calendar

Your calendar is your single source of truth for time commitments. Everything that has a specific time or date should live here.

### 2. Task Management

Tasks are action items without specific times. They should be organized by context and priority.

### 3. Notes and Reference

Your notes system should be searchable and easily accessible when you need information.

## Integration Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information lives in one place
2. **Flow Between Systems**: Make it easy to move items between calendar, tasks, and notes
3. **Regular Review**: Set aside time weekly to review and organize

## Getting Started

Start with one system and master it before adding complexity. Most productivity challenges come from over-engineering the system itself.
